I am a senior research fellow in the [Centre for Musculoskeletal Outcomes Research](https://uo-cmor.github.io) at the Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago.

My research area is health economics, with a specific focus on the measurement and valuation of health-related quality of life, economic evaluation of healthcare interventions, and simulation modelling of disease epidemiology and treatment to inform health policy.

Further details on my research interests and publications can be found under the [Research](/research/) tab above.
