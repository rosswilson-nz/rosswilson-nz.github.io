**Objective**
To estimate the potential lifetime health gains, healthcare costs, and cost-effectiveness of recommended adjunctive treatments for knee osteoarthritis delivered in addition to established core treatments, relative to core treatment only, from the perspective of the New Zealand (NZ) healthcare sector.

**Design**
Recommended adjunctive knee osteoarthritis treatments were identified in clinical practice guidelines. Evidence of effectiveness was sourced from existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Treatment costs were calculated by applying local reference prices to estimated resource use. We used a validated computer simulation model of the impacts of knee osteoarthritis to estimate the cost-effectiveness of each adjunctive treatment at willingness-to-pay thresholds of one (primary), two, and three times per-capita GDP ($NZ52 300).

**Results**
Data were collected on nine recommended adjunctive treatments: aquatic-based exercise, heat therapy, massage therapy, walking cane, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral NSAIDs, intra-articular corticosteroids, and duloxetine. Relative to core treatments only, walking cane and heat therapy were cost-saving and provided greater QALYs; aquatic exercise and intra-articular corticosteroids were also cost-effective at all WTP thresholds. Topical NSAIDs and CBT were cost-effective only at higher WTP thresholds, while duloxetine, massage therapy, and oral NSAIDs were not cost-effective at any relevant threshold. Results were generally robust to varying modelling assumptions, although topical and oral NSAIDs and CBT became cost-effective in some scenarios.

**Conclusions**
Delivering high-value, low-cost adjunctive interventions for knee osteoarthritis, alongside recommended core treatment, could deliver substantial health gains at low cost to the health system.
