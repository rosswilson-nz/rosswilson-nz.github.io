title: 'Computer simulation modelling for osteoarthritis in New Zealand (2015 â€“ 2020)'
---

This work was part of a project, led by Prof. Haxby Abbott at the Centre for Musculoskeletal Outcomes Research, to develop and evaluate a novel, early, coordinated programme of care for osteoarthritis in the New Zealand healthcare system. For this programme, I have led the development of a new microsimulation model of the population health impacts, healthcare costs, and treatment outcomes of osteoarthritis in New Zealand, which will be used for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the proposed programme of care. A journal article reporting on the model development and validation was published in Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, a study applying the model to provide projections of the future burden of osteoarthritis to the NZ health system and society has been published in the New Zealand Medical Journal, and an application of the model to cost-effectiveness analysis of interventions for the management of osteoarthritis in the NZ population has recently been published in Osteoarthritis and Cartilage Open as well as being presented at several conferences (including the OARSI World Congress, ISPOR European Congress, SMDM Annual Meeting, NZ Orthopaedic Association Annual Scientific Meeting, and Australian Physiotherapy Conference).
